i spent too much time troubleshooting this, so i better write it down

pyinstaller + pygame is not the greatest combo, some whacky shit causes .exe file to crash without a single error line. So, make sure you checked for these things:

1) NEVER set font to 'None'. Always use some fixed font, e.g. 'ariel', 'helvetica' and so on.
2) Loading images is a bitch to pyinstaller somehow. Without going into possibly long technical details (of which i'm not even sure of either way, tbh), you gotta tweak a few things in the .spec file.
+ Add a variable for misc files, like images and such, example:
    added_files = [('data', 'data'), ]
not sure if 'data' is the relative path to the folder with needed files, so i'll leave at that for now.
+ in a = Analysis(...) find attribute 'datas' (datas = []) and assign 'added_files' to it like this:
    datas = added_files

This is all for now, but i'm sure i'll encounter some more bs.
